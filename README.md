# Antibody Dinding Affinity Prediction

This repository contains a code sample I submitted as part of my OpenAI Residency application. The 'integrated.py' file includes all the functions and classes for antibody binding affinity prediction, while the 'train_models_example.ipynb' and 'use_model_example.ipynb' Jupyter Notebooks illustrate how to employ the functions defined in the 'integrated.py' file for training and utilizing machine learning models for prediction. This code aims to help researchers predict antibody binding affinity more accurately and efficiently.
