# antibody binding affinity prediction

This repository contains a code sample I submitted as part of my OpenAI Residency application. The 'integrated.py' file includes all the functions and classes for antibody binding affinity prediction, while the 'train_models_example.ipynb' and 'use_model_example.ipynb' Jupyter Notebooks demonstrate how to train and use machine learning models for prediction. This code aims to help researchers predict antibody binding affinity more accurately and efficiently. 

## Dependencies

The code depends on the following Python libraries:

- PyTorch (torch, torchvision)
- ESM
- Numpy
- Scikit-learn
- Torchmetrics
